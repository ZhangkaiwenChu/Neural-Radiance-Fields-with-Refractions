This project implement the light-bend neural radiance field (LB-NeRF) which is based on the paper ["LB-NERF: Light Bending Neural Radiance Fields for Transparent Medium"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9897642). It aims at modeling the refraction effect with an offset field using a neural network.
